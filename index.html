                <h3>ASK FOR THE NATIONS <img src="/images/forward.png" alt="" class="fwrd-img"></h3>
                <hr class="ask-hr">
                <p class="ask-p">Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost
                parts of the earth for thy possession. (Psalms 2: 8 KJV)</p>
                <p class="text">
                    Jesus Christ in Matthew Chapter 28 verses 18-20 gave a command to make disciples of all nations, meaning that the plan
                    of God is for all nations. In Psalm 24 the scripture says “The earth is the lord’s and the fullness thereof…”, again, we
                    see that God’s plan has always been for the whole earth. Now, if God plans to cover the whole earth, then it ought to
                    fill our prayers. The psalmist in our anchor text tells us that God says: ‘ask’. That is the key: asking in prayers. If
                    you ask, you will receive. You must ask! <br><br>
                    
                    The legal rights we have to a place in the realm of the spirit is gotten only when we go on our knees in prayer. You
                    must have a heart for nations, the passion must be so much that it drives you to your knees in prayers for that nation. <br><br>
                    
                    A nation doesn’t mean a country alone, it is the Greek word “ta ethne” meaning “all people groups”, it also means, a
                    tribe, people who are connected by shared beliefs and ideas. Don’t think of something ambiguous, think of those set of
                    people in a village, people from a particular tribe, they are nations. Jesus says make disciples of them. Bear a burden
                    for nations! <br><br>
                    
                    In the 18th Century, a movement called the Haystack movement started when a prayer meeting was halted by the rain and a
                    group of boys ran under a haystack as a shed and started sharing their passion to reach the unreached nations with the
                    gospel. They prayed again and the movement led to the founding of the American Missionary Society of whom Adoniram
                    Judson Jr (the great missionary to the Burmese people) was their first missionary. <br><br>
                    
                    Just like the haystack movement was founded back then and the passion of God burned in their hearts, you too must bear
                    this passion! <br><br>
                    
                    Remember that, the plan of God is for the whole earth!<br><br>
                    
                    So, spend time in prayers, spend time asking! If only we’d ask more, then we’d receive more.
                    Ask for the nations today, for there is no better endeavour!
                    .

                <h5>PRAYER/CONFESSION</h5>
                <p class="text">
                    Dear Lord, I pray that my heart is filled with a passion to reach the nations with the gospel. My heart is burdened with
                    thoughts of the lost and I respond by prayer. Dear Lord, I pray that the whole earth is filled with your glory and
                    splendour and that all men will come to know your name and will see you. Thank you, Lord, for I know that you have heard
                    me. Amen.
                </p>
