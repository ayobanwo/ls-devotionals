{"data":[{"id":174,"title":"ASK FOR THE NATION","body":"Jesus Christ in Matthew Chapter 28 verses 18-20 gave a command to make disciples of all nations, meaning that the plan of God is for all nations. In Psalm 24 the scripture says \u201cThe earth is the lord\u2019s and the fullness thereof\u2026\u201d, again, we see that God\u2019s plan has always been for the whole earth. Now, if God plans to cover the whole earth, then it ought to fill our prayers. The psalmist in our anchor text tells us that God says: \u2018ask\u2019. That is the key: asking in prayers. If you ask, you will receive. You must ask! The legal rights we have to a place in the realm of the spirit is gotten only when we go on our knees in prayer. You must have a heart for nations, the passion must be so much that it drives you to your knees in prayers for that nation. A nation doesn\u2019t mean a country alone, it is the Greek word \u201cta ethne\u201d meaning \u201call people groups\u201d, it also means, a tribe, people who are connected by shared beliefs and ideas. Don\u2019t think of something ambiguous, think of those set of people in a village, people from a particular tribe, they are nations. Jesus says make disciples of them. Bear a burden for nations! In the 18th Century, a movement called the Haystack movement started when a prayer meeting was halted by the rain and a group of boys ran under a haystack as a shed and started sharing their passion to reach the unreached nations with the gospel. They prayed again and the movement led to the founding of the American Missionary Society of whom Adoniram Judson Jr (the great missionary to the Burmese people) was their first missionary. Just like the haystack movement was founded back then and the passion of God burned in their hearts, you too must bear this passion! Remember that, the plan of God is for the whole earth! So, spend time in prayers, spend time asking! If only we\u2019d ask more, then we\u2019d receive more.

This is true even as seen in the Scriptures: the men God used were always men who were given to prayers and sought God diligently. We have examples in men like Abraham, Elijah, David, the prophets in the Scriptures, and the apostles. <br><br>\nWe have had examples in men of this age and time who were given to prayers and saw the mighty works of God done through them. One of such men was Daniel Nash. Father Nash, as he was popularly called, was a man solely committed to prayers. <br>\nHe committed himself, in the last seven years of his life, solely to praying for the ministry of Evangelist Charles Finney. If the evangelist was to hold a crusade in a town, Father Nash would go ahead to the town two to three weeks before to intercede for Finney and for the success of the work he was going to do there. He was often accompanied by Abel Clary who was his prayer partner. As sure as it was going to be due to the prayers offered prior, Charles Finney\u2019s crusades were a resounding success. Once, they had over 100,000 conversions from Rochester, New York after holding a 28-day crusade in the city. <br><br>\nNash\u2019s impact was so strong that, three months after his death, Charles Finney left the itinerary ministry and went into Pastoring because there was no one to offer prayers as Father Nash would. Such was his impact on Charles Finney\u2019s ministry. This should register in your mind that  <i><b>the work of God cannot be done without our being given to prayers.<\/i><\/b> <br><br>\nGod always needs a man to pray.

He had been diagnosed with tuberculosis, which would eventually kill him at the age of twenty-eight years. But despite this condition, he would pray so hard that by the end of the prayer, he wouldn\u2019t feel any strength in his hands and legs, while coughing and spitting out blood at every turn. After his death, it was discovered in his room that he had made knee-shaped indentations on the wooden floor due to constant praying at that spot. David Brainerd understood the labour that is involved in prayer. He understood that prayer is self-consuming, and he treated it like that whenever he prayed.<br><br>\nIn our anchor text, you won\u2019t miss the vivid description of the way Jesus prayed in Gethsemane, and how self-consuming it was.

He had earlier told His disciples that \u201cthe spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.\u201d The strength of the flesh can only get you so far, it is the Spirit that strengthens us. <br><br>\nPrayer is a battle, where we bend our will to God\u2019s own.

In fact, it is absolutely vital to your walk in the faith. <br><br>\nPray for your Pastors. Pray for your Leaders. It is the Bible way!

Prayer requires separation! There is a consecration that comes with prayer! This aspect of praying is so important that the writers of the gospel thought it essential to specify the times and places that Jesus prayed.<br><br>\nYou have to learn the art of withdrawal when you commune with God to focus on Him as is necessary. Rid yourself of anything that can distract or take away your attention.<br>\nJust like Jesus would go to the mountains and wilderness to pray, in a more contemporary sense, this can be likened to you staying away from your phone, family and friends deliberately just to be with the Lord. This doesn\u2019t happen accidentally but is a result of an intentional effort on your part.<br><br>\nWe also have a good example from the apostles to learn. Apostle Peter went to a rooftop to pray in the book of Acts, Apostle Paul prayed even in prison, John the beloved got the visions of the book of revelations praying alone on the island of Patmos. All these examples that we have in men show us a recurring pattern that there is a separation involved in prayer.<br><br>\nJesus Christ in our anchor text was about choosing the men who would work with him in the ministry and to whom he would eventually leave his work.

Not only should the believer be aware that he is in the spirit, but he should also walk in the spirit. The word \u2018walk\u2019 is the greek word peripateo which refers to the way and manner in which you conduct your life. So to walk in the spirit would mean to conduct yourself and your life in the spirit. <br><br>\nIf you are from the spirit but yet live in the physical world, God expects you to show forth the qualities of the spirit in this world.

Let it permeate your actions, let it fill your time, let it take over your day. Your mouth should continually mutter and utter tongues. You should keep speaking at every point.

Even though everyone was waiting, Simeon and Anna waited on the God of Israel differently concerning the coming messiah. .<br><br>\nPrayer made the difference in the way Simeon and Anna waited as well as fasting. The way they waited put them in a position to know the timing of God and recognize the messiah when he finally came.

This is the opinion and assumption of people who are too lazy to study and discover what is plainly explained in the Bible. It is without proof or basis from the Scriptures.<br><br>\nIt is important for you to know that the Bible was written for you to read and understand. Apostle Paul, in our anchor text, said he wrote to the Christians in Ephesus, not to confuse or mystify them, but so that they might understand the revelation of Christ just as he had understood it.<br><br>\nThe Bible is a document written by men but inspired by the Spirit of God (2 Peter 1:21). Understanding the intention and purpose for which it was written would facilitate the right approach and use of the Bible.<br><br>\nThe Bible is a document gathered over the years by different authors. It is neither a \u2018supernatural\u2019 nor a mystical book in itself. On the contrary, it is a literary material written by men, in the language of men, and to men.<br><br>\nSince the Bible is written by men and for men, there is a need for the readers of its content to diligently study it in order to get the exact message and intent of the author accurately. It is only expected that we scrutinize the writings of the prophets like any other literary material since they were written in the methods and language and culture of men.<br><br>\nThe Bible is God\u2019s message to you, and He doesn\u2019t want you to be oblivious to its truths.

The implication of this is that you can understand the Bible. It was written to pass a message across to you.<br><br>\nIt is also important for you to know that the truth of the Scriptures can and should be taught for men to understand. For example, in Acts 8:29-39, Philip was led by the Spirit to an Ethiopian eunuch who was reading the Scriptures.<br><br>\n\u201cHow can I, except some man should guide me?\u201d This was the eunuch\u2019s reply when Philip asked if he understood what he read. Philip will then proceed to explain and teach from the Scriptures that the eunuch was having trouble understanding. Without the help of a guide, the eunuch would not have heard the Gospel and consequently be saved.<br><br>\nWhile it is established that the Scriptures were written for us to understand, there is, however, a how to study the Scripture. There are laws of Bible Study. These laws guide us while studying in order to avoid misinterpretation and to get the exact message that the author is trying to pass across.<br><br>\nIt is worthy to note that since the Bible was written by men, (although under the inspiration of the Spirit) there was an audience they originally wrote to. The kind of audience they wrote to, the language and culture of the audience, and the time they wrote, all influenced the way the authors wrote. So, in studying the Bible, it is important to consider the contexts of the discourse, as well as the concepts applied in the texts. The meaning and use of words can vary from text to text depending on the context and concept. Being able to decipher the difference is a very useful skill during interpretation in guarding against misinterpretation of Scriptures. No word has a meaning of its own; every word derives its meaning from its context.<br><br>\nThe Bible is not difficult to understand but it requires that you pay attention in order to get its message undiluted.<br><br>\nDo not forget that you too can understand the Bible; in fact, this is the Lord\u2019s desire that you do.

Apostles like Peter, John, Jude, etc. had to stand their ground against waves of erroneous teachings and practices, vehemently opposing and writing against false prophets and encouraging those who doubted the faith (2 Peter 2:1). However, the basis of their authority and authenticity was found in their witness of all that Jesus did and taught.<br><br>\nThey never ceased to reiterate and defend the validity and reality of our faith. As eye witnesses of the ministry of Jesus and of His death and resurrection, they were diligent to establish the truth of what they had seen and heard: The Son of God walked the earth, loved men, healed them and taught them; He gave Himself on the cross for our sins and resurrected. This testimony is true. This is our Gospel.<br><br>\nJust like in our anchor verse, Apostle John would say,<i> \u201cI was there from the beginning. I heard and saw Him. I watched and observed Him. I touched Him and felt Him. He is real. He was the Word of life in the flesh.\u201d<\/i><br><br>\nSimilarly, Peter will say,<i> \u201cFor we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty\u201d<\/i> (2 Peter 1:16).<br><br>\nBut you see, the Christian faith is not only about a man who walked the earth, but also about a man who rose from the dead. Our faith is not based on mere facts and events alone, but also on spiritual realities. They gave witness of Jesus as a man, but more importantly, they preached a glorified Christ.<br><br>\nThis is why Paul was a spirit witness. He never saw Jesus in His humanity, but he saw Him glorified:<i> \u201cAnd last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time\u201d<\/i> (1 Corinthians 15:8). Paul said, <i>\u201cChrist died for our sins...he was buried...he rose again the third day according to the scriptures<\/i> (1 Corinthians 15:8). Paul also gave another basis for the reality of our faith when he said <i>the spirit of God beareth witness with our spirit that we are the sons of God<\/i> (Romans 8:14).<br><br>\nIn summary, we have the witness of the scriptures, and the witness of the indwelling of the Spirit. Never be caught off guard such that you begin to believe a lie.<br><br>\nToday, I would have you reminded that your faith is real and solid. The Christian faith is founded and built on truths and facts coupled with supernatural occurrences worked by the Spirit of God over the ages.

Well, this is not a vague statement in Christianity, it applies to us the most. There is a history of who were, where it all started from, the glitches that came along the way, and who the Lord wants us to be even in the days to come.<br><br>\nDo you know that there was a time in the Christian faith when ordinary men had no access to the Bible but only the monks, priests, and the pope had access to it? At that time the church basically depended on what the Pope told them with the belief that the pope who had access to the Bible would have read and understood the content.<br><br>\nThis in no little way affected the church, its spirituality, and its conducts because it gave the right to many practices and traditions that had no basis in the scriptures but only benefited the purses of the leaders, who like Apostle Paul said in Philippians 3:19,<i> their god was their bellies.<\/i><br><br>\nStories (about vampires, goblins, etc.) were invented to keep people in fear and bondage with no choice but to heed their man-made laws and practices. Some of those practices were payment in cash for the forgiveness of sins, even for their dead, prayer to Mary\/the saints, infant baptism and so much more!<br><br>\nIt was a very terrible state that the church was in until Martin Luther (a 16th Century monk and theologian) came forward after years and years of studying the Bible, and gave a defence of righteousness by faith, he held unto this truth as he had seen and studied from Romans 1:17 <i>which says for therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, the just shall live by faith<\/i>.

Hence, you shouldn\u2019t read your experiences into the Bible rather you should take the Bible and make it your experience.

Today, not forgetting that the Lord will have us understand the truth of the scriptures for what it truly is and not some hearsays, we will consider what this scripture means. What does it mean to grieve the spirit?<br><br>\nIn that text Ephesians 4 from verse 30, Apostle Paul further explained that when believers make comments that do not edify another, are unkind to one another, and are unforgiving, they grieve the holy spirit. In other words, grieving the Holy Spirit is hurting another believer.<br><br>\nThis reminds me of an event that happened when I was quite younger, I witnessed a friend in church engage in a fight with someone who had taken her pen and she said, \"in this case, I will put Jesus aside and fight that idiot that took my pen\". She was so uncouth in the way she spoke; she didn\u2019t give room for explanations or even repentance from the other party. I was taken aback and I began to wonder and recall how that Jesus in his words had told us <i>to love our neighbours just as we love ourselves<\/i>. Many believers today are like this friend of mine; they have other realities that are separate from the word of God. One of our realities as believers is love. Our God is love.<br><br>\nPaul in 2Corinthians 5 guides us on how to perceive and see other believers when he said in verse 16<i> \u201cwherefore, henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more\u201d<\/i>. Saying that just as Jesus was once in the flesh and was perceived as just a man physically, by His death and resurrection we do not see Him as that again, rather we now know and see Him as our Lord and saviour.<br><br>\nToday also, the believer by the virtue of his salvation should not be perceived as a mere man nor should he be regarded as just a man in the flesh that exists physically but as a supernatural man. So when relating with other believers and others as well, do so from the place of love and even when they offend you, love helps you to regard and esteem them as you should.<br><br>\nI admonish you today, work peaceably with all men, walk in the spirit for you are in the spirit and not of the flesh.

Scripture presents different instances where Jesus would either open the eyes of the blind, get the lame walking, unstop deaf ears, and in some places, bring the dead back to life.<br><br>\nThis is a pointer to God\u2019s disposition to sicknesses and diseases. He wants to heal them all! Many have had the wrong impression of who God is. They hold the belief that God is afflicting them with an illness because of a sin or misdeed they committed in times past. This is a lie from the devil. It is the devil\u2019s nature to darken a man\u2019s heart and hold him in bondage by bringing condemnation to his heart. He makes you think; \u201cOh, I made a grievous mistake 20 years ago, and now God is punishing me for it\u201d<br><br>\nCondemnation weakens a man\u2019s ability to trust God for healing. Our anchor text shows us that Jesus did not discriminate. He healed all that were brought to him, that is exactly who God is- Our healer. And he will heal time and again. There is no end to his healing abilities, and that is still true today!<br><br>\nGod is interested in your health; He wants you to walk in perfect health. Scriptures tells us in Acts 10:38 that Jesus went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed of the devil.  It is God\u2019s nature to heal as it is the devil\u2019s character to oppress. One of the ways God shows us that he cares for us is His willingness to heal and make us whole.<br><br>\nIf Jesus did not make anyone sick, it goes without saying that God will not afflict you with sickness. Rather, He is more than able to make you whole. So, whenever the devil brings condemnation to your heart and tries to justify the pain you are feeling, remind yourself that pain is not of God. Jesus is the Healer, and if he healed those unsaved, how much more you an heir of salvation? Hallelujah!<br><br>\nAre you sick in your body? God is willing to heal you!

He had compassion on her and healed her without question. He did this on a Sabbath despite opposition from the Jews. They felt it was their holy day and were angry that Jesus healed the woman. See Jesus\u2019 response in verse 16<i> and ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan hath bound, lo, these eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the Sabbath day?<\/i><br><br>\nJesus said she had a right to healing because she was Abraham\u2019s daughter. She should not have been bound in the first place, not to talk of eighteen years!  In the verse preceding our anchor text, we see that it was Jesus who called her to him. He was willing. And He informed her \u2018you are loosed\u2019 not \u2018you will be loosed\u2019. Jesus did not ask what she did wrong or what she did not do right, He simply went ahead to heal her. God is more eager to heal you than you are to get healed.<br><br>\nHealing is the children\u2019s bread. Jesus said this to the Gentile woman in Matthew 15. She had come to Jesus to ask for her daughter\u2019s healing. Jesus told her that healing is the children\u2019s bread and although she was a Gentile, she laid hold on the crumbs, and her daughter was healed.

Jesus said the bread belongs to children, this implies healing is the children\u2019s right from a loving Father God. <br><br>\nIt is noteworthy that Jesus was willing to defy traditions and nasty protocols to set her loose!

He says: \u2018be of good cheer\u2019, meaning to be bold and confident. The believer is assured of victory and this is a constant outcome in any of life\u2019s situations. These are the words of Jesus to His disciples, and us today. He has overcome, and by effect, we have the victory. <br><br>\nThe world Jesus was referring to in our anchor text is not sin, rather, He was talking about trials and all the evil in the world. The victory He gives is independent of what happens in the world.

The fact that an opinion is popular does not mean it aligns with what God has said in His word. So, if it is not in line with God\u2019s word, it is safe to discard it.

His words to His disciples and ultimately to you in the preceding verse is to take no thoughts as to food, drink, and raiment. These things capture man\u2019s basic necessities \u2013 what to eat, what to wear, and where to lay our heads. In today\u2019s world, we call them the three basic needs of man - food, clothing, and shelter.<br><br>\nGod knows that need these things.

It is important to note that the word \u2018<b>Kingdom<\/b>\u2019 here is not referring to salvation, rather it refers to service; all that we do in service to God should not be need-driven.<br><br>\nWhy would Jesus make such a statement? It is easy to get blinded by the cares of this world and to think that service to God would be a means to get them. No doubt God wants to meet our needs, but he also does not want us to serve Him because of these needs. Our service to God should be driven by love. It should come from a place of understanding that God gave us the greatest gift he has in salvation, and because of that understanding, we go all out to serve.<br><br>\nGod does not want your relationship with him to be transactional, he desires that you and he have a father-son relationship that transcends the usual.

That sounds hilarious, right?  It is only natural that you prefer your child to a pet and if you are asked to save one out of both, you wouldn\u2019t give a second thought before picking your child. You would naturally take care of your child\u2019s needs and go out of your way to ensure he\/she has the best things that are within your reach.<br><br>\nNow, take that love you have for your child and multiply it in a billion ways. That and even more is how much God cares for you. He wants you to have no question in your heart as to His love for you.  His greatest show of love is seen in how He gave Jesus to be our saviour.

People get disappointed when things go south because they think God does not care. It could be on the issue of who to marry, an illness, and maybe a need that you have been trying to meet. God is a Father whose love for us exceeds that which we share with our parents, siblings, and even children.<br><br>\nJesus fed the multitude in the wilderness with bread and fish.

Nothing can be more misguided.<br><br>\nImagine someone walks up to you and asks to be your friend, he then goes ahead to list some terms and conditions which would include losing a part of your body the day you default or fail to live up to his expectations. No one in his proper mind would agree to such friendship. This is the image of God that we paint when we say that God loves us, but he doesn\u2019t accommodate our mistakes and excesses.<br><br>\nDoes this mean God does not correct his children? Absolutely not! A careful look at our text would tell us that God indeed chastises us and that\u2019s because He loves us. Now, a very good question to ask would be, \u2018How does God chastise us?\u2019 \u2018What is God\u2019s tool for correcting us?\u2019\nGod\u2019s method of communicating His mind to us is His word. This would mean that all God has to say to us has been said in His word. God\u2019s tool for instructing and correcting us is His word. Hear what Paul says to Timothy in 2nd Timothy 3:16, All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: the word correction would describe a straightening, the way metal is straightened out.<br><br>\nThe phrase \u2018instruction in righteousness\u2019 paints a picture of the way a child is raised and trained. It goes to say that God\u2019s method of correcting and training us is His word. God does not punish us with evil.  Just as you would not inflict your child with a headache because he did something wrong, God does not bring illness your way because of a wrong you committed. He also does not push you into the devil\u2019s care to be afflicted.<br><br>\nThe writer of Hebrews further established to us that God\u2019s correction is for our profit. The endpoint is to produce in us fruits of righteousness. God trains us with His word not to destroy us, but to the end that it yields in us peaceable fruit of righteousness. When correction comes to us in God\u2019s word, we must be open to being trained by it, so that it can work its work in us.<br><br>\nGod\u2019s method of correcting His children is His word.

The calling of God is for every man, to become the person He wants us to be and to do the things he designed us to do and this can only be achieved through the knowledge of his Son, Jesus.<br><br>\nFirstly, a man becomes what God wants him to be (saved) immediately he acknowledges and receives Jesus as his Saviour. Jesus was sent into the world to save the world from their sins through his death and resurrection. Those who believe in him receive eternal life and then, begin their journey God\u2019s way (John 3vs16).<br><br>\nEveryman\u2019s Journey with God begins immediately after salvation, he receives a new life and this is the eternal ability of the man who has believed.

In that, the salvation of the rest of the world now depends on the response of those that are saved (2Corinthians 5vs17-19) \u201c<i>\u2026all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation\u201d.<\/i><br><br>\nThis is the calling!

By his saving grace, we now have access to justification, the forgiveness of sins, the gifts of the spirit, and our forever union with Christ. It is of utmost necessity that a believer stays conscious of these realities. As a believer, you must always live your life on the edge of eternity. This means the goal of your life as a Christian can only be achieved when you stay conscious and alert at all times.<br><br>\nThe believer must not live a drowsy life or a life that is unsure about what God is doing. When a man is saved by believing the gospel of Jesus, he becomes the channel through which God does his work on the earth. This gives the man in Christ a reason to be sober and to use his thoughts and actions for the service of the Lord.<br><br>\nBeing sober is not just abstinence from the things that are not profitable to your life as a believer, but also your active involvement in the things that will make you function better spiritually. Being sober will not only help you stop doing the wrong things, but it will also make you do the right things.<br><br>\nYour Christian life is about the doing! As a believer, you are not to be a hearer alone but a doer of God\u2019s word (James 1:22). You must be conscious of your spiritual realities because what you fill your thoughts with is what your actions become.<br><br>\nBeing a supernatural man, I charge you to stay on the edge, do not be too comfortable with the irrelevancies of the world that you forget that you were made and called for a purpose. Being on the edge can be literally compared to standing at the edge of a cliff, at such a position, you are careful and focus to avoid slipping. For the man in Christ, this carefulness is not for the fear of falling because there is an assurance that God\u2019s got you but this carefulness and mindfulness are to the end that you fulfil your ministry. It is so that you don\u2019t miss out of that plan that God is willing to execute in the earth today through you.<br><br>\nHow do you stay on the edge? This only happens in the place of prayer! Prayer aligns your mind, it makes you sober, with clear sight, and keeps you prompt to do the right things. In essence, you must know clearly that you can\u2019t be sober nor be on the edge by simply trying to, this is only achieved through prayer. Just as Apostle Peter charges in his epistle,<i> \u201cBut the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer\u201d <\/i>(1 Peter 4:7), I charge today to stay sober!\n","day":"2022-09-26","bible_text":"Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ;<br> (1Peter 1:13).","prayer":"Dear Lord, thank you for the access you have given me to all your blessings in Christ Jesus.

This was done through his death and resurrection. He was known for his constant offering of prayers, even his disciples had to ask \u201cTeach us to pray\u201d (Luke11:1).<br><br>\nOne of the most remarkable times of his prayer was at Gethsemane, the prayer before his crucifixion. He was going to lay down his life soon and he knew that he would only be able to achieve this will of God by submitting himself in prayers to God. The scripture records that he was in anguish yet, he prayed; he was tired, yet, he was strengthened to pray much more, and that his sweat was as great drops of blood to the ground, even then he prayed much more (Luke 22:39-46).<br><br>\nWhy was this so? This is because, if it is about doing or fulfilling God\u2019s will on the earth, prayer is not an option but a necessity!<br>\nThe story of the Moravian brethren wouldn\u2019t have been recognized as one of the greatest stories in the history of the church, but the results of their praying lifestyle made the difference. They launched the canopy of prayer with some men and women who committed themselves to an hour of prayer each day. This committed prayer chain swept through the community lasting over 100 years!  They didn\u2019t pray just in one location, but in their normal lives at home, on walks, and during work breaks.

Because of this revival, this small group of the Moravians sent out seventy missionaries who went and lived among unreached people groups, learned their language and culture, then told them about Jesus Christ. This is remarkable. The Moravians had learned that the secret of loving the souls of men was found in loving the Savior of men through the offering of prayers, they demonstrated the same and saw tremendous results just as the Lord had promised (1 John 5:14).

Therefore, go and make disciples of all nations, baptising them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you.\u201d  <br>\nThe mandate is to GO! <br>\nThis mandate is popularly referred to as the great commission. The work, our Lord Jesus, committed into our hands is to \u201cGo and make disciples of all nations\u201d.  <br>\nYou must know that to get this fulfilled; there is a price to pay. You should be aware that this is a course you must follow to the end. <br>\nYou cannot fulfil the work that the Lord has committed into your hands without counting the cost.  <br>\nJesus explaining this to His disciples, gave them a scenario in Luke 14:28 how that a man that sets out to build a house and cannot finish it would be subject to ridicule because He was not ready for the cost that it would require to finish so He left the house unfinished.  <br> <br>\nPrior to that, Jesus in Luke 14:26 also teaches about something imperative to our faith. He said, \u201cIf any man comes to me and hates not his father, and mother, and wife and children - yes, even his own life, he cannot be my disciple\u201d.  <br> <br>\nIt would seem as if a man who doesn\u2019t hate his family cannot be a disciple of Jesus but actually see what Jesus was saying.  <br>\nThe word \u201chate\u201d doesn\u2019t mean being heartless towards family but favouring or prioritising less when a comparison is made. <br>\nThe emphasis is on priority, self-denial, and absolute surrender. In other words, we should never choose our families or our ambitions over loyalty to the work Jesus asked us to do, and even when this looks like a tough decision, it is not a difficult one. It is the cost required to follow; it must be Jesus before anything else.  <br> <br>\nFollowing Jesus is a serious business.  <br>\nIt\u2019s dreadful to start and not finish.  <br>\nYou must \u201csit down first and count the cost!  <br>\nWithdraw first, and ask yourself the essential questions. Christians are never to choose self-preservation over doing the work.  <br>\nThe cost of following is high, but the cost not to follow is higher.  <br>\nLastly, you should know that it costs nothing to be saved, but to follow Jesus costs everything, and I would love to let you know that Jesus is worth the cost.  <br>\nHe is worth everything you have.  <br> <br>\nYou must see this truth that should be your reality today and get to the point where you see and know that if you lose Jesus, you lose everything, and if we gain Jesus, we do not need anything else.

Today we will be considering how the scriptures used it. <br>\nFrom our anchor text, the writer of Hebrews explains that the worlds were created by faith. Worlds here refer to dispensations of time that describe how God dealt with and worked with\/in\/through men. <br><br>\n\nThese men, referred to as elders, had a good report, also referred to as a witness. They had a confession; the same word scriptures used to describe witnessing the resurrection of Jesus. The Apostles used the same word as regards preaching the gospel. These elders had a confession by faith.<br>\nWe see that by faith, the different dispensations of times were constructed by an underlying utterance of God. Meaning that the stories we now see, hear, and read in the scriptures are not just events but a product of words that have been said.\nIt is worthy to note that even though we read the lives of these elders as a story today, by faith in the Lord, they lived and played out God\u2019s story into existence.<br><br>\n\nLooking at the story of Cain and Abel, they both brought sacrifices to the Lord. But according to the scriptures, God had respect for Abel\u2019s sacrifice but didn\u2019t do the same for Cain\u2019s. Unfortunately, many have misinterpreted the dealing of God with Cain and Abel over the years. They often think that God\u2019s disposition to their sacrifices was only because of the kind of sacrifice that Cain and Abel brought in terms of fruits\/sheep.\nHowever, Hebrews 11 helps us see the real reason for the disparity in the sacrifices they offered; it was because Abel offered His sacrifice with faith in His heart while Cain didn\u2019t. So this wasn\u2019t about sheep or fruits but about their faith in God.<br><br>\n\nHebrews 11 opens our eyes to God\u2019s perspective on things; it is clear that, without faith, it is impossible to please the Lord. The men who have walked with God have only done it by faith - faith in His word; they all had a witness in their hearts.\nTheir walk with God was not smooth because they were the most perfect of men, nor was it because they offered God the best of gifts; their walk with God was smooth and lasted so long simply because they had faith; they believed God.<br><br>\nGod himself was more interested in keeping a relationship with them, and they rested in His promises. \nBy faith, many have conquered the world and will still conquer. \nOur walk with God is purely faith-based and not sensual at all.\nFaith means holding on to God\u2019s word irrespective of circumstance. Seeing God\u2019s promise fulfilled just as He has spoken and \u201cjudging Him faithful who has promised.\u201d\nSo behind the stories on the surface, there was an underlying utterance, today again in this dispensation, God is still writing stories with men, God is still walking with and through men. \nWouldn\u2019t you rather trust in His word?\n","day":"2022-10-06","bible_text":"Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.
